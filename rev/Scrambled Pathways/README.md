### Solution:

1. **Divides the String:** It separates the original string into three parts based on their positions (every third character).

2. **Fills Three Bins:**
   - The first bin collects characters from positions 0, 3, 6, etc.
   - The second bin collects characters from positions 1, 4, 7, etc.
   - The third bin collects characters from positions 2, 5, 8, etc.

3. **Recombines the Characters:** It combines the characters from the three bins in a specific order to create a new string.

4. **Prints the Result:** Finally, it prints the newly formed string as the "Flag".
